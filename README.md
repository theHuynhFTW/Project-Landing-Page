# Project-Landing-Page
Encompassing project to test HTML and CSS knowledge

After progressing through the Odin Project course, this is the project which encompasses my knowledge so far about HTML and CSS. The premise for this project is to create or replicate rather a website from scratch while using a provided picture as a reference point. 

So far the courses have had HTML and CSS codes semi-completed for us to fix up so that it works correctly. Thus this was the first time starting with a completely blank page. I believe that the project was extremely useful of course for putting my new skills to use, but probably more useful for practicing logically approaching how to layout a website. Definitely starting from one block to the next allowed me to not be overwhelmed with what to start on and allowed me to establish a workflow.

Some challenges I faced while tackling this project was the pictures I used were being distorted (aka they looked horrible). I googled around and stumbled upon the object-fit command which allowed me to keep the aspect ratio of the original image so that it would not look untastefully stretched. 

Another was that I know that many others are doing the project as well, and we are all using the same reference image. I wanted to try to at least try to do something a little different and so I put in the search bar at the top and a pop-up when you click sign-in. Though the sign-up pop-up is purely aesthetic and does not function the way a real one would, I considered if I should really include it or not. I did use google to learn how to do it purely with CSS as other languages are out of my repertoire, but the examples were much less explanation of concept and more of a just do this approach. I did do some experimenting with the HTML layout and CSS values and whatnot to try and understand what each part was doing but overall still a foreign concept.
